// Object Prototypes

// Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another.

// It is like a single template object that all objects inherit methods and properties from without having their own copy.


// arr._proto_(reference)
// Array.prototype (actual object)
// String.prototype


// Every object in JavaScript has a built-in property, which is called its prototype. The prototype is itself an object, so the prototype will have its own prototype, making what's called a prototype chain. The chain ends when we reach a prototype that has null for its own prototype.
